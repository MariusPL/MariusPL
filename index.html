        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm an international undergraduate student at UCLA, double majoring in Computational Linguistics and Psychology. I was born in Chile, grew up in China and Taiwan, formed my identity in Argentina, and found myself in Hong Kong. My interests include -- but are not limited to: Reinforcement Learning, NLP (transformers), language acquisition, code optimization. Even though I am an atheist and advocate of science, I enjoy spirituality and art, often engaging in philosophy, music, photography, and architecture. </p>
